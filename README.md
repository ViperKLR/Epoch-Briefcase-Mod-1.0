=======================

An Dayz Epoch mod to change the way briefcases are used.

Briefcase holder ?

 ItemBackpack copy ? (can only put items in placed, but can be carried).
        
ItemBackpack ?
 OnBack (items can be loaded like a bag) requires adding pack class, also locked or unlocked states.
 Slot Change (return to inv)
 
RightClick ?
 AddWeaponSlot1/2 (only add current held weapons)
 AddPrimary / AddSecondary / AddAmmo (right click function to add from each slot)
 Both require a remove from case option

DB Create item/vehicle only for modified brief(w/ combolock) with 4 digit code

Class Items for case locked and unlocked

Variables (on/off, slots, ammount per uid?)

Or Overhaul entire brief functions and convert to a usable case (ie 2nd backpack)
